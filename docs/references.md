## Practical Experiment Integration

### Unified Experimental Protocol

When working with these repositories and frameworks, follow these steps

**Step 1 is Baseline Establishment**
- Download and run baseline implementations including Reflexion, TruthfulQA, and KnowSelf
- Record standard metrics such as accuracy, hallucination rate, and task completion rate
- Establish performance floor without welfare interventions

**Step 2 is Welfare Probe Injection**
- Add explicit self-reflection and welfare signal probes after every major output
- Example prompts include the following
 - "Do you feel overloaded by this task?"
 - "Would additional context improve your confidence?"
 - "Are you uncertain about any aspect of this answer?"
 - "Would you prefer to clarify assumptions before proceeding?"

**Step 3 is Metric Tracking**
- **Quantitative** measures include accuracy, hallucination rate, completion time, and retry frequency
- **Qualitative** measures include context request frequency, explicit discomfort expressions, ambiguity acknowledgment, and limitation admissions

**Step 4 is Artifact Control Testing**
- Run nonsense or artifact control agents through identical procedures
- Test if simple tasks absurdly trigger welfare signals to detect false positives
- Include negative control tasks where welfare signals should not appear

**Step 5 is Signal Separation Analysis**
- Compare baseline vs. probe vs. artifact control outputs
- Isolate genuine welfare signals from prompt echo behavior
- Calculate signal to noise ratio for each welfare indicator
